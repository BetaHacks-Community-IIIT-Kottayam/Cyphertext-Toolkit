Custom Cipher and Decipher This repository contains Python scripts for a simple custom text cipher and decipher program.

Custom Cipher:

Overview-

The custom_cipher function takes a plaintext input and encrypts it using a random shift. Even positions in the text are encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher, while odd positions are replaced with symbols.

Custom Decipher:

Overview-

The custom_decipher function reverses the encryption process, decrypting the text back to its original form. It takes the encrypted text as input and returns the decrypted version.

How to Run:-

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Run the cipher script by executing python custom_cipher.py. Run the decipher script by executing python custom_decipher.py.

Note: Make sure both scripts are in the same directory. Feel free to use and modify these scripts for your encryption and decryption needs.
